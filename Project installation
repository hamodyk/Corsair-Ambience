A guide for installing the project on Visual Studio

1. Start a C++ console project in Visual Studio 2017
2. Copy include, lib and redist folder into the Root of the project
3. Go to Project properties-->C/C++-->General-->Additional Include Directories, Add the follow line: $(SolutionDir)include\
4. Go to Project properties-->Linker->General-->Additional Library Directories, Add the follow line: $(SolutionDir)lib\x64\
5. Go to Project properties-->Linker->Input-->Additional Dependencies, set it to the following: 
D3D11.lib;dxgi.lib;kernel32.lib;user32.lib;gdi32.lib;winspool.lib;comdlg32.lib;advapi32.lib;shell32.lib;ole32.lib;oleaut32.lib;uuid.lib;odbc32.lib;odbccp32.lib;gdiplus.lib;libcurl.lib;CUESDK.x64_2013.lib;kernel32.lib;user32.lib;gdi32.lib;winspool.lib;comdlg32.lib;advapi32.lib;shell32.lib;ole32.lib;oleaut32.lib;uuid.lib;odbc32.lib;odbccp32.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies)

6. Go to Project properties-->Build Events-->Pre-Build Event-->Command Line, add following line: xcopy /Y /I "$(SolutionDir)settings.ini" "$(OutDir)"
7. Go to Project properties-->Build Events-->Post-Build Event-->Command Line, add following line: xcopy /Y /I "$(SolutionDir)redist\x64*" "$(OutDir)"
8. Apply all of those

Notes:
- All of the above should already be set for you if you just clone the project
- You might need to retarget the solution (Right click on the Solution 'Corsair Ambience' then choose 'Retarget solution')
- Your run mode (Debug or Release) must be set to x64 for the settings above to work
