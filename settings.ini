#### DOCUMENTATION:
####
###### RefreshInterval:
######### The interval in milliseconds of which the app samples the screen.
######### The lower the number is, the higher the CPU usage is.
######
######
###### HorizontalStep/VerticalStep:
######### The lower these numbers are, the higher the CPU usage, and the better sampling quality.
######### Setting both of them to 1 would mean that every pixel on the screen will be sampled (not recommended)
######### For better performance, you can increase them up to 16 without hurting the quality too much.
######
######
###### HorizontalZones/VerticalZones:
######### When on zone coloring mode, the screen will be split to horizontal and vertical zones
######### if HorizontalZones = x and VerticalZones = y, that would mean that the screen will be
######### split into x*y zones.
######
######
###### PinToMonitor:
######### Allows you to pin the app to a specific monitor, which means that the
######### pixels data/colors will be gathered only from that specific monitor.
######### -1 or 0 means it will gather data from all monitors.
######### This feature is available only when DXGI API is on.
######
######
###### KeyboardZoneColoring/MousePadZoneColoring:
######### Each individual LED of the keyboard/mouse will have a color based
######### a screen zone it belongs to
######
######
###### FilterBadColors:
######### It's highly recommended to keep this option on. 
######### When it's on, it removes black/white and colors with low RGB diff
######### making the led colors look much more vibrant.
######
######
###### DXGI_API:
######### A low level API for capturing the screen pixels data. Requires DirectX 11 and at least Windows 8.
######### It's much faster than GDI (~6ms vs GDI's ~27-37ms) so it's highly
######### recommended to keep this option on. If it's off, GDI will be used.
