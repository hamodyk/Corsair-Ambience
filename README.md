# Corsair-Ambience
Corsair RGB Ambience - Set your Corsair devices' led colors based on what you see in your screen



# DISCLAIMERS: 
- USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES YOU CAUSE TO THE SYSTEM/HARDWARE THAT YOUR RUN/INSTALL THIS APPLICATION ON.

- I'M NOT ASSOCIATED/AFFILIATED WITH CORSAIR IN ANY SORT OF WAY. I'M JUST USING THEIR SDK.

# Road Map
- Create a GUI
- Add more configurations (such as sleep time, number of pixels to sample etc...)
- Add more coloring options (such as most dominant color, elimination of dark colors etc...)
- Make it an installable app
- Add option to start the app on Windows start up
- Performance impact testing

# Q&A
Q- Does the app also work while using fullscreen applications such as games?

A- Yes

Q- Will it hinder my computer's performance?

A- The app uses ~ 1% - 1.5% CPU, so I wouldn't think so. Some actual performance impact testing is required though.


# Troubleshooting
### Problem:
I'm getting the following error - "Handshake failed: CE_ServerNotFound"

### Solution: 
Make sure you have started iCUE or CUE, and make sure that the "Enable SDK" option is ticked in the settings. If it's already on, try to untick it and then tick it back.


# Compatible Devices
Every Corsair RGB device should be compatible with this software except:
- RAM
- Liquid cooling solutions

Reason: Lack of SDK on Corsair's side
